A simple, visual tool to determine the amount of circumferences that can be placed around a bigger one. This was developed as part of my M. Sc. in chemistry to determine the number of gold nanoparticles that can be placed around a polymer micelle.

This is still a work in progress feel free to open a new issue or PR.
